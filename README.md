Additional Details:

- The project involves three datasets: content, reaction, and reaction types.
- The initial step is to preprocess the datasets by removing irrelevant columns and rows that do not contribute to the analysis.
- Once the data is cleaned, the primary and secondary columns are of interest for analysis and visualization.
- Through analysis and visualization techniques, insights will be provided regarding the months with higher app usage and the category with the best score.
- The final deliverable includes presenting the analysis findings to the client, effectively communicating the identified trends and insights.
